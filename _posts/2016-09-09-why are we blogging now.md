> It always seems impossible until it is done

Ever since I joined Bajra, I have wanted to write a blog for Bajra. To be honest, I have been blogging, but it was mostly focused on my travel stuffs and less on tech stuffs. Now that Bajra Weekly is official, I can finally hone my skills on the tech stack as well. In this tech era, having presence in the internet is a must, that is why we connect to social media doing our micro blogging there. Via Bajra Weekly, we want to share something that would be useful to everyone in and outside of Bajra Tech. This is why we have started blogging now. We know that it does sound like an incomplete answer, so here are some reasons why we are blogging now-

* Sharing knowledge on different tech stack

	Bajra has different teams working on different projects. Those different projects are built on different tech stack. I keep myself up to date with the tech stack I am working on via mailing lists and if I find something really awesome, I would also want others to know about it. The other programmers working on a different stack would obviously not know about it. This weekly blog can therefore help to bridge that gap.

* Sharing solutions to the problems
	
	There can be more than a way to solve an issue, but there might be one better way to solve it in an optimized manner. The thing is that, if it has happened to you, it can happen to anyone or it has already happened to someone. You can write about the way you solved that problem and hopefully that "anyone" might come across the post and find it useful.

* Sharing things beyond the tech stuffs

	Not everyone at Bajra codes. We have HR Manager and Financial Officer working with us as well. They also need to blog since they might also have something cool to share . I do not know about you, but I am a nerd with diverse interests. As much as you think coding is a tough job,HR Management and financial management are equally difficult in their own ways. So let us read about how to manage a company or how to manage finances in a company. Who knows, you might end up starting your own business some day.

* Letting the World know what Bajra is up to
	
	> Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life. 

	Working for Bajra, from my personal experience, has been so much fun. Apart from work, BajraBeings(that`s what we call ourselves) spend a lot of quality time together, mostly mobile gaming. You must be wondering how that is possible in our busy schedule. I would say, you have no idea how mobile gaming has brought the co-workers together, created a strong bond and mostly made us feel like a family.

Finally, let me end this blog with a sweet picture of Bajra Family. We are not all in it but I am putting it here to show you all how good looking we are. I am the one wearing the ACDC tanktop.
