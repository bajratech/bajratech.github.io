Hello Everyone, what's on this weekend?

Here in **Bajra**, we have started weekly bolging which exicites me for bloging. Today I am going to share my views and experiences in this blog. Firstly, thanks to all of our **Bajra Beings** for providing this awesome platform to share our knowledge, experiences and resuming our habit of writing skill which we would forget instead.

As we know **Bajra** has release it's own product ***Site Granny***, it was built on *Rails 4*, now it has been upgraded to *Rails 5* with a new feature ***Action Cable*** for web socket implementation.

After waiting a long time, I got an chance to learn **Android** on **Xamarin**. Studing new technical courses exicites me. I am very happy to learn Android. I suggest all of technical budies to study mobile development as this world is going to be in our pocket in future. Here I am sharing guides and tutorials to learn **Android** on **Xamarin**. with Xamarin, we can develop Android, iOS and Windows app. For Android firstly read guides this will give you all concepts of

1. [Android Guide for Xamarin](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/#android)
2. [Android Video Tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCuRg51-gw5VqYchUekCqxUS9hEZkDf6l)

Yesterday ***Sublime Text 3*** was released with new features. As a developer, I thought it should be included in this blog.
**Features:**
1. Build errors are now shown inline, at the location the error occurred. This is done via the new Phantoms API, which allows HTML annotations to be added to the text buffer by plugins.

{% include image.html
            img="/public/images/posts/build_error.png"
            title="Sublime Build Error"
            caption="Inline Build Error" %}


2. Show Definition, which will show where a symbol is defined when hovering over it with the mouse.

{% include image.html
            img="/public/images/posts/definition.png"
            title="Sublime Definition"
            caption="Sublime Definition" %}
