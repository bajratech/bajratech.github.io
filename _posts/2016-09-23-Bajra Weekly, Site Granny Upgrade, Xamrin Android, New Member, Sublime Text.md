Hello Everyone, what's on this weekend?

Here in **Bajra**, we have started weekly blogging which excites me for blogging. Today I am going to share my views and experiences in this blog. Firstly, thanks to all of our **Bajra Beings** for providing this awesome platform to share our knowledge, experiences and resuming our habit of writing skill which we would forget instead.

As we know **Bajra** has release it's own product ***Site Granny***, it was built on *Rails 4*, now it has been upgraded to *Rails 5* with a new feature ***Action Cable*** for web socket implementation.

In our **Bajra Beings** one new team member is added in this month.




After waiting a long time, I got an chance to learn **Android** on **Xamarin**. Studying new technical courses excites me. I am very happy to learn Android. I suggest all of technical buddies to study mobile development as this world is going to be in our pocket in future. Here I am sharing guides and tutorials to learn **Android** on **Xamarin**. with Xamarin, we can develop Android, iOS and Windows apps. For Android firstly read guides this will give you all concepts of

1. [Android Guide for Xamarin](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/#android)
2. [Android Video Tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCuRg51-gw5VqYchUekCqxUS9hEZkDf6l)

Yesterday ***Sublime Text 3*** was released with new features. As a developer, I thought it should be included in this blog.
**Features:**
1. Build errors are now shown inline, at the location the error occurred. This is done via the new Phantoms API, which allows HTML annotations to be added to the text buffer by plugins.

            caption="Inline Build Error" %}


2. Show Definition, which will show where a symbol is defined when hovering over it with the mouse.
