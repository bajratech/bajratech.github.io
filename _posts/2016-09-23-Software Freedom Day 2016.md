Hello Everyone!

Lets start with one of my favorite events, **Software Freedom Day 2016**, which was held at Agarwal Vawan, Kamal Pokhari last Saturday. The event was amazing and more exciting than I had expected it to be. I and some of my college friends were very happy to be a part of the event. The event was inaugurated with our **Nepali National Anthem**.

**Speeches**<br>
The event started with a speech of **Mr. Prakash Neupane**, where he spoke about why **Software Freedom Day** is celebrated and how it used to be celebrated in the past. The next speaker of the program was **Dr. Nama** from Kathmandu Living Labs, who presented different projects done on OpenStreetMap and open source software. He also talked about The Reconstruction of Nepal. He also lighted on how his team with Nepali engineers and Nepal Government conducted a program for data collection to rebuild the nation. About 6TB of data was collected within 3 months. People like him who are dedicated to Rebuild the Nation glorify the pride of the nation.

Last but not the least, there was another speaker, **Mr. Mahabir Pun**, Magsaysay Award Winner and pioneer of wireless Internet in the villages of Myagdi District. He talked about the importance of Software Freedom Day in the context of Nepal. He also mentioned his new idea of establishing Nepal's first **National Invention Center**. He described how the Invention Center can help the youth in building the nation. In his entire session, he mostly talked about the Nation and how we can rebuild our  nation.

**Hackathon**

While the main event was going on, we were busy with *Hackathon* on the third floor. Almost four teams had participated in the hackathon. Our mentors, Mr. Prakash Neupane and Hempal Shrestha, gave us some ideas to research on our projects before building the platform. Hempal Shrestha sir also cross-questioned us as why, who and how to use our projects. Here are some stills of the program.
