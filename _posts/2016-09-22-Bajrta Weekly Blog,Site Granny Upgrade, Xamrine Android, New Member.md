Hello Everyone, what's on this weekend?

Here in **Bajra**, we have started weekly bolging which exites me for bloging. Today I am going to share my views and experiences in this blog. Firstly, thanks to all of our **Bajra Beings** for providing this awesome platform to share our knowledge, experiences and resuming habit of writing skill which we would forget instead. 

As we know **Bajra** has release it's own product ***Site Granny***, it was built on *Rails 4*, now it has been upgraded to *Rails 5* with a new feature ***Action Cable*** for web socket implementation.

After waiting a long time, I got an chance to learn **Android** on **Xamarin**. Studing new technical courses exictes me. I am very happy to learn Android. I suggest all of technical budies to study mobile development as this world is going to be in our pocket in future. Here I am sharing guides and tutorials to learn **Android** on **Xamarin**. with Xamarine, we can develop Android, iOS and Windows app.
