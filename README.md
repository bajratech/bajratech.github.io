##Bajra Weekly #### - Keep Calm and Keep Blogging

Welcome to **Bajra Weekly**

To post a new blog , create a file with the format `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP` inside the `_posts` directory. I hope you will write you blog in markdown :smile:

After you have finished writing your blog, send a PR to `Loomila Hada`. Then open your favourite text editor and start to code again. :laughing:
